# Math Dumps

This repository contains my personal collection of resources and work related to various mathematical topics. It's a constantly evolving project, reflecting my ongoing learning and exploration.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by mathematical subject, with each top-level folder representing a different area of study.

- **abstract-algebra:** [Link to abstract-algebra folder](abstract-algebra)
  - This directory contains resources related to abstract algebra, including textbooks and materials from the MIT OpenCourseWare course 18.703 (Abstract Algebra). It includes lecture notes, assignments, exams, and other supplementary materials.
- **analysis:** [Link to analysis folder](analysis)
  - This folder houses resources related to mathematical analysis, including textbooks and personal notes in LaTeX format.
- **combinatorics:** [Link to combinatorics folder](combinatorics)
  - This directory focuses on combinatorics, including textbooks, research papers, Sage notebooks, and specific personal research projects like the study of caterpillar parking functions. This is an area of particular interest to me.
- **misc:** [Link to misc folder](misc)
  - This folder serves as a catch-all for miscellaneous mathematical topics that don't fit neatly into the other categories.

## My Experience

My background combines **Enumerative Combinatorics** and **Computer Science**. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of these two fields, exploring how computational methods can be applied to combinatorial problems.

Currently, I have written a paper in algebraic combinatorics is getting reviewed by international journals.

## My Interests

My primary interests lie in **Mathematical Research** and **Computer Assisted Proofs**. I'm fascinated by the potential of using computers to aid in mathematical discovery and verification. I dream of the day research mathematics becomes as collaborative as software development is today.
